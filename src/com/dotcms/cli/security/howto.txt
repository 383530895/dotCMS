These helper classes can be used to import an Apache .crt file and .key into
keystores usable by Java and the dotCMS.


KeyStoreImportKey: 
takes 5 parameters: kestore (absolute path), keystore_passwd, 
cert's alias, keyfile for the cert that must be imported, certfile to import.

TrustStoreImportKey: 
takes 4 parameters: truststore (absolute path), 
truststore_passwd, cert's alias, certfile to import.

Both the classes need the certfile and the keyfile (only for KeyStoreImportKey) 
into the right format (DER).

As an example, suppose that our cert and key are under the name "server.crt" and "server.key"

1. openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in server.key -inform PEM -out myServerKey.der -outform DER

2. openssl x509 -in server.crt -inform PEM -out myServerCert.der -outform DER
