-- There is no sql script here but you need to execute the jsp located in /html/portlet/ext/utils/AssignHosts.jsp
-- to reassign the hosts back to the templates, containers and contentlets
-- This jsp tries to find the correct host to assign based on the parent folder that the asset had before,
-- but if the asset was created recently it could be without a parent folder, in this case the default host will be
-- assigned to the asset
